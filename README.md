==================

A roll playing game

NOTE: This is not the 1975 Role Playing game released by Flying Buffalo, this is a private user role playing game I put together for my cousins and I one Thanksgiving Break. We're looking for a better name, but for now T&T it shall remain.

Characters have a Race and Class chosen on creation that are unchanging
They also with (usually) 22 Points to spend on the 6 Attributes, aka Stats:
Move, sub stats: Speed, Initiative
Attack, sub stats: Ranged Attack, Range
Defense
Luck, sub stats: Magic Defense, Search, Luck Points
Magic
Wounds

Any stat besides Wounds can be rolled. The system uses a pool of D6's that succeed on a 5 or 6 normally.
Upgraded or blessed dice (denoted by a '*' after the number) succeed on a 4,5, or 6.
Downgraded or Cursed dice (denoted by a '-' after the number) succeed on only a 6.

Editable fields besides the stats include/Wanted features:
Race Benefit with mark for used (only some races)
Class skills
Class Spells With field for difficulty or button for incrementing difficulty (and reset for mana potions?) - only shows up   if Class type = Caster
Consumable Items with Hover Text
